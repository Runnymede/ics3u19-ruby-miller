/**
 * This program stored the grid and the values in it in a 2D array, which has 0s (empty), 1s (red), and 2s (yellow). <br>
 * The user will first be asked what colour they want to represent the empty spaces in the grid. <br>
 * The program will print a 6x7 board which will be updated, and printed again every time a game piece is placed. <br>
 * The program will ask the users where they want to play their game pieces, and the spot on the grid they entered will turn their colour. <br>
 * If a player wants to put their game piece in a column that is already full, or a number not in the range of 1-7, the player will be asked to enter somewhere else. <br>
 * The program will be able to detect 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, and will print who won. <br>
 * It can also detect when the board is full, and there are no 4 in a row, it will then print out that itâ€™s a tie. <br>
 * The user will be able to replay once the game is finished using a loop. <p>
